- This page will automatically refresh and display the current exercise instructions.  If your session has timed out, you may not receive the the new content.  Clicking on *Student* in the menu above will refresh the browser and reconnect you to the service.
- During hands-on labs, the instructor may display a timer in the title of the browser. This provides guidance on when the class might resume and the lab time conclude.
- Please indicate when you have completed a lab by clicking the checkbox at the top of the page.  If you are not going to do the lab in class, please check that you have completed.  The instructor uses this information to determine the pace of the course.  Since, in virtual meetings, the instructor cannot actually see you and your progress, this is one of the only ways we have to determine the pace of the course.  We want to provide ample time for everyone to finish hands-on labs
- Please contact the instructor if you need help with any of the hands-on labs
